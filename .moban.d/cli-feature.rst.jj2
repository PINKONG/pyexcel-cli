**{{name}}** brings `pyexcel <https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel>`_ to make it easy
to consume/produce information stored in excel files on command line interface.
This library can turn the excel data into a list of lists, a list of records(dictionaries),
dictionaries of lists. And vice versa. Hence it lets you focus on data in shell
programming, instead of file formats.

Hightlighted features:

#. View data in the excel files without Microsoft Office or Open Office
#. Transcode data among supported excel file formats
#. Merge files in various excel file formats into one
#. Split a multi-sheet excel file into single sheet files
#. Find difference in data between two excel files

Because pyexcel family is loosely coupled, especially for file format supports, you
install the libraries that you need to. If you need to support xls format, you will
need to install pyexcel-xls. For more information, please see the plugin section.
